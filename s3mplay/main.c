/* Small S3M player written as AICA firmware
 *
 * (c)2000 Dan Potter
 *
 * Notes on using:
 *
 * To use this player, you just need to load your S3M into sound RAM
 * at 0x10000, and then load this program into the ARM CPU. This program
 * will then parse the S3M into samples and tracks, etc, and start 
 * playing it. To stop the playback, use dc_snd_stop_arm() in libdream.
