README for S3MPlay (version 1.0)

This is a work in progress. The player is distributed under the MIT
licensing terms. Basically they say that you can do whatever you want
to with this, as long as you don't change it and then distribute it
saying that it's the same library (i.e., you claim it's the original
"s3mplay") or that you change it and say that you wrote it. Additionally,
there is NO WARRANTY on the program or its functionality.

This program plays S3M module files (like from PC demos) using the processing
power of the AICA CPU core. Basically you just turn off the AICA CPU,
load your S3M into 0xa0810000, then load this program at 0xa0800000, and
turn on the AICA CPU. After a few seconds you ought to hear your song coming
out of the Dreamcast.

The player still has some bugs in it, but I think that the sound code itself
is pretty much golden. =)

If you'd like to change and recompile it, you'll need the GNU toolchain
built for ARM7. Specifically you'll need GCC and AS. These can be built in
exactly the same way you built the SH4 toolchain -- just follow the
directions on the Hitmen page except use these configure lines:

../binutils-2.10/configure --target=arm-elf --prefix=$prefix
../gcc-2.95.2/configure --target=arm-elf --prefix=$prefix --without-headers
	--without-libs

That ought to do it for you. I have included the aica_fw.h that has the
precompiled version though.
