    The Trainer Menu for DC by volkor : Quick doc.
    ----------------------------------------------

# What you've got in the package is :

Trainer.bin     : The trainer executable in the "release" version
TrainerGD.bin   : The Trainer executable in the "test" version
TRlinker.exe    : The linker !
*.s3m           : Some music for the menu...
*.ini           : Some .ini example.
Trainor_doc.txt : hu?
description.txt : An example file of a text to be displayed in the 1st screen
                  of the trainer. The text is limited to 16 lines of 23 chars.

# How to add the trainer to a game :

Find the Cheats for the game, then make a .ini (just copy and modify one
provided for example). The order of the options within the .ini is important.
The text for the scrolltext should be on only one line. You must numerotate
the options from 1 to "TR_noptions". Every option have 3 lines :
option n
Menu text (34 chars max)
One line with the cheat itself. 1st number is the size of the cheat code.

Run "TRlinker something.ini" from a windows command line. You should see
something like that :
"Operation sucessfull. 888888 bytes written to patched_game.bin"
Now the packer and padder is included so the file "patched_game.bin.lzo" will
be the good one.

# notes :

You can link the menu with the .s3m you like. But the Player is very buggy !
So be carefull !
